1. What is Polymorphism? Try to explain in Mandarin.
在物件導向中，Polymorphism(多型)是指不同種類的物件(object)，可以被一個統一的介面(interface)連結，與繼承(Inheritance)是一體兩面同時成立的條件。
舉個例子，我有一個名為車的介面(interface)，而不同類型的車，可根據接收這個名為車的分類的介面，進一步衍生成不同車型，此為初步多型(Polymorphism)的概念。


2. Here are the 7 important lifecycle methods of an Activity. Try to explain when are they called during thelifecycle of Activity.
i.onCreate(): This is called the first time the activity starts and is therefore only called once during the lifecycle of the activity. It represents when the activity is created and initialized. The activity is not yet visible and you can't interact with it.
ii.onStart(): This is triggered when the activity is about to become visible. It can be called multiple times as the user navigates away from the activity and then back.
iii.onResume(): This is triggered when the activity has focus and the user can interact with it.
iv.onPause(): The mirror method to onResume. This method is called as soon as the activity loses focus and the user can't interact with it.
v.onStop(): This is the mirror method to onStart. It is called when you can no longer see the activity.
vi.onDestroy(): This is the mirror method to onCreate. It is called once when the activity is fully destroyed.

4. What is Coroutines? Why we use it? Try to explainin Mandarin.
Kotlin Coroutines 是 Kotlin 的一個官方函式庫讓開發者以便利方式撰寫非同步程式設計模型、非封鎖 (Non-blocking) 及並行 (Concurrency) 的程式。
因為不希望使用者在應用程式中執行耗時操作時，發生整個應用程式卡住的狀況，透過非同步程式設計可以實現應用程式在處理耗時操作的同時能繼續處理其它工作。
